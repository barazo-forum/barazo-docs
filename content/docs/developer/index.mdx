---

Welcome to the Barazo developer documentation.

## Getting Started

Barazo is an open-source forum platform built on the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/). It uses portable identity (DIDs), user-owned data (stored on Personal Data Servers), and typed lexicon schemas (`forum.barazo.*`).

## Sections

- **API Reference** -- REST API endpoints, authentication, and rate limiting (auto-generated from OpenAPI spec)
- **Lexicon Reference** -- `forum.barazo.*` schema documentation (auto-generated from TypeScript types)
- **Plugin Development** -- Building and publishing portable plugins
- **AT Protocol Concepts** -- DIDs, PDS, AppView, firehose, and how Barazo uses them
- **Contributing** -- Development setup, coding standards, and PR workflow
